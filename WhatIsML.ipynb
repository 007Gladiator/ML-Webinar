This idea of \"Hebbian networks\" has existed since the 1940s, but it really only became a machine learning technique with Paul Werbos' 1975 introduction of \"backpropagation\" as a means to train such networks. Either way, the ideas are fairly old.\n",

What makes a particular trained network special is the set of \"weights\" in the connections, illustrated and commonly named as subscripted  $w$ values.\n",

For example, the extremely power Inception v3 image classifier consists of approximately 23.8 million parameters across about 140 layers. Layers generally each have many more neurons than the dozen or fewer shown in textbook illustrations like the one above. Scikit-learn has basic neural network techniques, but their use is mostly for the uses that made sense more than five years ago.\n",

The distribution of these measurements is likely not to be uniform and linear (in which case scaling might be relevant), but there is a real thing being measured. Measurements might be quantized for continuous variables, but that does not necessarily make them ordinal instead. For example, we might measure annual rainfall in each town only to the nearest inch, and hence have integers for that feature."

These may be cutoff values where a \"good enough\" estimate is obtained, for example. Or there may be hidden terms in an underlying equation that can be set.

Models in scikit-learn typically have a number of hyperparameters to set before they are trained (with \"sensible\" defaults when you do not specify)."
