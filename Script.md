# Machine Learning with scikit-learn

## Overall Introduction: Welcome to Machine Learning



## Lesson 1: What is Machine Learning?

* Difference between "Deep Learning" and other ML techniques
* Overview of techniques used in Machine Learning
* Classification vs. Regression vs. Clustering
* Dimensionality Reduction
* Feature Engineering
* Feature Selection
* Categorical vs. Ordinal vs. Continuous variables
* One-hot encoding
* Hyperparameters
* Grid Search
* Metrics

## Lesson 2: Exploring a data set

* Looking for anomalies and data integrity problems
* Cleaning data
* Massaging data format to be model-ready
* Choosing features and a target
* Train/test split

## Lesson 3: Classification

* Choosing a model
* Feature importances
* Cut points in a decision tree
* Comparing multiple classifiers

## Lesson 4: Regression

* Sample data sets in scikit-learn
* Linear regressors
* Probabilistic regressors
* Other regressors

## Lesson 4: Clustering

* Overview of (some) clustering algorithms
* Kmeans clustering
* Agglomerative clustering
* Density based clustering: DBSan and HDBScan
* n_clusters, labels, and predictions
* Visualizing results

## Lesson 5: Hyperparameters

* Understanding hyperparameters
* Manual search of parameter space
* GridsearchCV
* Attributes of grid search and wrapped model

## Lesson 6: Feature engineering and feature selection

* Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
* Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF)
* Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)
* Independent component analysis (ICA)
* SelectKBest
* Dimensionality expansion
* Polynomial Features
* One-Hot Encoding
* Scaling with StandardScaler, RobustScaler, MinMaxScaler, Normalizer, and others
* Binning values with quantiles or binarize

## Lesson 7: Pipelines

* Feature selection and engineering
* Grid search
* Model

## Lesson 8: Robust Train/test splits 

* cross_val_score
* ShuffleSplit
* KFold, RepeatedKFold, LeaveOneOut, LeavePOut, StratifiedKFold
